# Zoho Voice Integration - COMPLETED

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Successfully integrated Zoho Voice SMS functionality with intelligent sender selection and unified message display.

### Schema Changes ✅
- **Studio Model**: Added `twilioPhone` and `zohoVoicePhone` fields (migrated from `smsPhone`)
- **Message Model**: Added `provider` enum ('twilio' | 'zoho_voice') and `zohoMessageId` field
- **Data Migration**: Recovered all Twilio phone numbers from message history

### Zoho Voice API Integration ✅
- **Message Polling**: Fetches SMS logs when contact loads (`GET /rest/json/v1/sms/logs`)
- **Phone Number Normalization**: Converts all numbers to 10-digit format for database consistency
- **Studio Mapping**: Maps Zoho Voice numbers to studios, labels unknown as "Unknown"
- **Message Saving**: Caches all fetched messages to database for performance

### Sender Selection Logic ✅
**Admin Users (philip_admin & KevSandbox):**
- Can send as any studio that has been in conversation with this contact
- "Admin" option for Twilio fallback
- Dropdown shows only studios with conversation history

**Regular Studios:**
- Can send as their own studio (if Zoho Voice available)
- "Admin" option for Twilio fallback
- Limited to 2 options max

### Message Display ✅
- **Full Conversation**: Always shows all messages (no filtering by sender)
- **Provider Labels**: Messages show "Studio Name (provider)" or "Admin"
- **Smart Defaulting**: Dropdown defaults to sender of most recent message
- **Unified Timeline**: Twilio and Zoho Voice messages merged chronologically

### Sending Logic ✅
- **Zoho Voice Priority**: Send via Zoho Voice for studio numbers
- **Twilio for Admin**: Only use Twilio for philip_admin number
- **No Fallbacks**: No automatic fallback from Zoho Voice to Twilio
- **Proper Attribution**: Messages saved with correct studioId based on actual phone used

### Key Features
- **Real-time Sync**: Fetches new Zoho Voice messages on page load
- **Phone Formatting**: Handles various formats (10-digit, +1, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and detailed logging
- **Admin Controls**: Enhanced permissions for admin users

## Technical Notes
- Zoho Voice API requires `ZohoVoice.sms.READ` and `ZohoVoice.sms.WRITE` scopes
- Phone numbers stored as 10 digits in database for consistency
- Message provider indicated in UI with (twilio) or (zoho_voice) labels
- Admin messages always show as "Admin" regardless of who initiated
